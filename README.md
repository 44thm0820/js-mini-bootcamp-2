# Hack Reactor: JavaScript Mini Bootcamp I

Welcome to part one of Hack Reactor's JavaScript Mini Bootcamp. In today's session we'll be covering the following topics:

- Part I: Foundations of Programming
- Part II: Functions
- Part III: Booleans, Comparisons & Conditionals
- Part IV: Logical Operators & Advanced Conditionals
- Part V: Variables

Each section consists of a lecture followed by a set of self-guided exercises. The self-guided exercises can be found in each section's respective folder in this repository. Before getting started, make sure that you have a JavaScript console open (like <a href="http://www.repl.it/languages/javascript" target="_blank">repl.it</a>), so you can complete all of the exercises.
